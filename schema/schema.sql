## Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
postgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate PgADMIN to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is uses a 75-25 split.  Machine learning models used include:
     - Logistic Regression
     - SVM
     - Decision Tree
      Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate TABLEAU for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Google Slide.
